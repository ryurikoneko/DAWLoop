FLSkill does not claim authorship of the bundled FL Studio MCP implementation. The upstream source snapshot is stored under [`third_party/fl-studio-mcp/`](third_party/fl-studio-mcp/); its original MIT license is preserved at [`third_party/fl-studio-mcp/LICENSE`](third_party/fl-studio-mcp/LICENSE). The root [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) applies to FLSkill-authored files and does not replace the bundled project's license.

The vendored snapshot contains only the upstream files needed to run its MCP server and install its FL Studio scripts. The demo video and upstream installer scripts are not bundled.
